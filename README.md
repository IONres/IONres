### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Olga

I am an organizational psychology researcher.
I would like science and practice to interact more closely. And I want to contribute to this.
I am confident that the combination of scientific knowledge, practical experience and the automation of certain processes will help the organization become more efficient while maintaining the well-being of its employees.
